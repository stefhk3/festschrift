abstract = "Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is an enzyme of glycolysis that interconverts glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) but, outside the cell, is a multifunctional cytokine. High-resolution crystal structures of the enzyme from mouse have been determined in native form and in complex with the inhibitor erythrose 4-phosphate, and with the substrate glucose 6-phosphate. In the substrate-bound structure, the glucose sugar is observed in both straight-chain and ring forms. This structure supports a specific role for Lys518 in enzyme-catalyzed ring opening and we present a â€�pushâ€“pullâ€� mechanism in which His388 breaks the O5â€“C1 bond by donating a proton to the ring oxygen atom and, simultaneously, Lys518 abstracts a proton from the \{C1\} hydroxyl group. The reverse occurs in ring closure. The transition from ring form to straight-chain substrate is achieved through rotation of the C3â€“C4 bond, which brings the C1â€“C2 region into close proximity to Glu357, the base catalyst for the isomerization step. The structure with \{G6P\} also explains the specificity of \{PGI\} for glucose 6-phosphate over mannose 6-isomerase (M6P). To isomerize \{M6P\} to \{F6P\} requires a rotation of its C2â€“C3 bond but in \{PGI\} this is sterically blocked by Gln511. "

abstract = "We introduce a new computability model, of a distributed parallel type, based on the notion of a membrane structure. Such a structure consists of several cell-like membranes, recurrently placed inside a unique â€œskinâ€� membrane. A plane representation is a Venn diagram without intersected sets and with a unique superset. In the regions delimited by the membranes there are placed objects. These objects are assumed to evolve: each object can be transformed in other objects, can pass through a membrane, or can dissolve the membrane in which it is placed. A priority relation between evolution rules can be considered. The evolution is done in parallel for all objects able to evolve. In this way, we obtain a computing device (we call it a P system): start with a certain number of objects in a certain membrane and let the system evolve; if it will halt (no object can further evolve), then the computation is finished, with the result given as the number of objects in a specified membrane. If the development of the system goes forever, then the computation fails to have an output. We prove that the P systems with the possibility of objects to cooperate characterize the recursively enumerable sets of natural numbers; moreover, systems with only two membranes suffice. In fact, we do not need cooperating rules, but we only use catalysts, specified objects which are present in the rules but are not modified by the rule application. One catalyst suffices. A variant is also considered, with the objects being strings over a given alphabet. The evolution rules are now based on string transformations. We investigate the case when either the rewriting operation from Chomsky grammars (with respect to context-free productions) or the splicing operation from H systems investigated in the \{DNA\} computing is used. In both cases, characterizations of recursively enumerable languages are obtained by very simple P systems: with three membranes in the rewriting case and four in the splicing case. Several open problems and directions for further research are formulated "

abstract="In the attempt to have a framework where the computation is done by communication only, we consider the biological phenomenon of trans-membrane transport of couples of chemicals (one say symport when two chemicals pass together through a membrane, in the same direction, and antiport when two chemicals pass simultaneously through a membrane, in opposite directions). Surprisingly enough, membrane systems without changing (evolving) the used objects and with the communication based on rules of this type are computationally complete, and this result is achieved even for pairs of communicated objects (as encountered in biology). Five membranes are used; the number of membranes is reduced to two if more than two chemicals may collaborate when passing through membranes.",

We have previously developed an abstraction for biomolecular systems using the Ï€-calculus process algebra, which successfully handled their molecular and biochemical aspects, but provided only a limited solution for representing compartments. In this work, we extend this abstraction to handle compartments. We are motivated by the ambient calculus, a process algebra for the specification of process location and movement through computational domains. We present the BioAmbients calculus, which is suitable for representing various aspects of molecular localization and compartmentalization, including the movement of molecules between compartments, the dynamic rearrangement of cellular compartments, and the interaction between molecules in a compartmentalized setting. Guided by the calculus, we adapt the BioSpi simulation system, to provide an extended modular framework for molecular and cellular compartmentalization, and we use it to model and study a complex multi-cellular system.

States of a machine are chemical solutions where floating molecules can interact according to reaction rules. Solutions can be stratified by encapsulating subsolutions within membranes that force reactions to occur locally. We illustrate the use of this model by describing the operational semantics of the TCCS and CCS process calculi and of the fragment of Milner, Parrow and Walker's Calculus of Mobile Processes used by Milner to encode the lambda-calculus. We also give ideas on how to extract a higher-order concurrent Î»-calculus out of the basic concepts of the chemical abstract machine."

This new feature allows one to control the order of application of rules when deriving transitions of process terms. Our method is powerful enough to deal with rules with negative premises and copying. We show that rules with orderings, called ordered SOS rules, have the same expressive power as GSOS rules. We identify several classes of process languages with operators defined by rules with and without orderings in the setting with silent actions and divergence. We prove that branching bisimulation and eager bisimulation relations are preserved by all operators in process languages in the relevant classes."

abstract = "Structured Operational Semantics (SOS) is a popular method for defining semantics by means of transition rules. An important feature of SOS rules is negative premises, which are crucial in the definitions of such phenomena as priority mechanisms and time-outs. However, the inclusion of negative premises in SOS rules also introduces doubts as to the preferred meaning of SOS specifications. Orderings on SOS rules were proposed by Phillips and Ulidowski as an alternative to negative premises. Apart from the definition of the semantics of positive GSOS rules with orderings, the meaning of more general types of SOS rules with orderings has not been studied hitherto. This paper presents several candidates for the meaning of general SOS rules with orderings and discusses their conformance to our intuition for such rules. We take two general frameworks (rule formats) for SOS with negative premises and SOS with orderings, and present semantics-preserving translations between them with respect to our preferred notion of semantics. Thanks to our semantics-preserving translation, we take existing congruence meta-results for strong bisimilarity from the setting of SOS with negative premises into the setting of SOS with orderings. We further compare the expressiveness of rule formats for SOS with orderings and SOS with negative premises. The paper contains also many examples that illustrate the benefits of SOS with orderings and the properties of the presented definitions of meaning."

abstract = "Abstract This chapter surveys the semantic ramifications of extending traditional process algebras with notions of priority that allow some transitions to be given precedence over others. The need for these enriched formalisms arises when one wishes to model system features such as interrupts, prioritized choice, or real-time behavior. Approaches to priority in process algebras can be classified according to whether the induced notion of pre-emption on transitions is global or local and whether priorities are static or dynamic. Early work in the area concentrated on global pre-emption and static priorities and led to formalisms for modeling interrupts and aspects of real-time, such as maximal progress, in centralized computing environments. More recent research has investigated localized notions of pre-emption in which the distribution of systems is taken into account, as well as dynamic priority approaches. The latter allows priority values to change as systems evolve and enables an efficient encoding of real-time semantics. Technically, this chapter studies the different models of priorities by presenting extensions of Milner's Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) with static and dynamic priority as well as with notions of global and local pre-emption. For each extension, the operational semantics of \{CCS\} is modified appropriately, behavioral theories based on strong and weak bisimulation are given, and related approaches for other process-algebraic settings are discussed.

abstract = {We introduce a process calculus with a new prefixing operator that allows us to model locally controlled reversibility. Actions can be undone spontaneously, as in other reversible process calculi, or as pairs of concerted actions, where performing a weak action forces undoing of another action. The new operator in its full generality allows us to model out-of-causal order computation, where causes are undone before their effects are undone, which goes beyond what typical reversible calculi can express. However, the core calculus, which uses only the reduced form of the new operator, is well behaved as it satisfied causal consistency. We demonstrate the usefulness of the calculus by modelling the hydration of formaldehyde in water into methanediol, an industrially important reaction, where the creation and breaking of some bonds are examples of locally controlled out-of-causal order computation.}

abstract = {A current research topic in membrane computing is to find more realistic P systems from a biological point of view, and one target in this respect is to relax the condition of using the rules in a maximally parallel way. We contribute in this paper to this issue by considering the minimal parallelism of using the rules: if at least a rule from a set of rules associated with a membrane or a region can be used, then at least one rule from that membrane or region must be used, without any other restriction (e.g., more rules can be used, but we do not care how many). Weak as it might look, this minimal parallelism still leads to universality. We first prove this for the case of symport/antiport rules. The result is obtained both for generating and accepting P systems, in the latter case also for systems working deterministically. Then, we consider P systems with active membranes, and again the usual results are obtained: universality and the possibility to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time (by trading space for time).}

We describe distributed algorithms for collecting and dispersing information, leader election in these systems, and the mutual exclusion problem. Finally, we consider membrane systems producing correct results despite some failures at some of the components or the communication links. We show that membrane systems with antiport carriers provide an appropriate model for distributed computing, particularly for message-passing algorithms interpreted here as membrane transport in both directions, namely when two chemicals behave as input and output messages and pass the membranes in both directions using antiport carriers.}

The functioning of the pump is described and analyzed in the formal framework of P systems, considered here as tools for modelling a bio-cellular process. New features such as variable membrane labelling, activation conditions for rules, membrane bilayer and specific communication rules are defined, to the aim of providing a more appropriate description of the pump. A Sevilla carpet of the sodium-potassium pump is given, as a starting point to identify the pumps as the processors able to execute the rules of a high-level P system in a maximal parallel and nondeterministic manner, activated and controlled by steady-state concentrations.

The key feature of the calculus was a new prefix operator of the form (s; b), where doing of action b triggers undoing of one of the actions in s. Because of this connection between doing and undoing of actions (or forming and breaking of bonds in a chemical modelling) we called this local reversibility. We have shown that our calculus enables out-of-causal order reversibility. In this paper we demonstrate the Base Excision Repair of DNA, a high-level biological example, using our calculus. We also introduce a software which allows us to check the syntax of processes and to simulate their execution.",

Interactions are modeled at the domain level, bonds are represented by means of shared names, and reactions are required to satisfy a causality requirement of monotonicity. An example of a simplified signalling pathway is introduced to illustrate how standard biological events can be expressed in our protein language. A more comprehensive example, the lactose operon, is also developed, bringing some confidence in the formalism considered as a modeling language. Then a finer-grained concurrent model, the mκ-calculus, is considered, where interactions have to be at most binary. We show how to embed the coarser-grained language in the latter, a property which we call self-assembly. Finally we show how the finer-grained language can itself be encoded in π-calculus, a standard foundational language for concurrency theory.}

Each perspective adds its contribution to the understanding of the system, thus the three approaches do not compete, but complement each other. We illustrate our approach by applying it to an extended model of the three stage cascade, which forms the core of the ERK signal transduction pathway. Consequently our focus is on transient behaviour analysis. We demonstrate how qualitative descriptions are abstractions over stochastic or continuous descriptions, and show that the stochastic and continuous models approximate each other. Although our framework is based on {P}etri nets, it can be applied more widely to other formalisms which are used to model and analyse biochemical networks.",
