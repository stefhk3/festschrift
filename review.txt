1. The process terms describing the systems are long and somehow difficult to follows. For
instance, the given example, involving only 6 pairs of bases, results in a half a page formula (page
22). While there is some effort to simplify the term, the notation is still long and much of the text in
pages 23-29 contains redundant information. A suggestion here is the use something similar to the
global-local handling notation used in the K-framework (see, e.g., https://kframework.org/).

>I understand this is asking for some formal short notation. I will check that kframework. 

2. Quite often, graphs are useful in grasping intuition on process terms. Maybe developing a
graphical representation of the CCB processes may simplify understanding and pave a way towards
including geometrical information on DNA shape.
Detailed comments (page, global line numbers):

>This asks not for some graphics (which we have got), but a graphical version of the calculus. I will look at this. Generally, both comments may not be easy to do without needing more space.

p2,25: DNA errors often occur when DNA is used for reading the information about the proteins to
be synthesized in the cells.

>Not sure about this. We are talking about wrong replicated DNA. It can happen that a protein is produced wrongly from DNA (or RMA), but that is not a matter of "gene repair". Might be interesting, but it is different.

p5,110: bee

>Corrected.

p6,130: Maybe a short clarification of the distinction strong-weak actions is useful at this point.

>Not sure what exactly the reviewer is thinking about. The distinction is really in the operational semantics, and those follow later.

p6,140: "use Î±, s and s, sâ€² to denote a concatenation" - the notation is unclear; include some
parentheses ( ), or " " to separate the terms from the text

>Not sure what's best. If we say "use (Î±, s) and (s, sâ€²)" it looks like the () are part of the syntax. And more spaces is odd. We have the italics. Doesn't that show it?

p7,150: "A collection Î¼ is either Ïƒ or Ïƒ | Ïƒ" - if the is a BN-like syntax, should be Ïƒ | Î¼

>I think that's a correct remark, it needs changing.

p7,155: The syntax includes also recursive definition, not included in that one-line description

>Don't understand this. The "one-line description" is P ::= S | mu:P | P|Q | P\L, I assume - this has recursion?

p8,185: "(s; b).C | P | C | C | P | C \ L" - confusion of two roles of "|"

>I think we need to use spaces similar to p7

p10,Fig3: b does not appear in this rule

>b is in the s rule.

p11,Fig4: similar

>we use beta here.

p12,Fig5: similar somehow, it is unclear why do you use condition * and **; why not simply
include those particular cases explicitly?

>for me, this was just because of space.

p12,Ex3: it seems to be a confusion here between b,d,f - check this example again

>Corrected. uses b and d (not b and b) since b is weak and d is not.

p13,Fig6: what is "t" in concert2 act?

>That should be eta

p16,275: Is this strong-weak action explanation useful at p6,130?

>I am not sure if just moving this is useful. And if we want to give the reason etc. on 130 as well, it means reorganising a lot

p22,top: "The MMR system in full detail..." Actually, this is the result after all reactions in the
previously described MMR system are used. It shows an order of firing transitions in the original
system to arrive at this form, directly linked to the picture in Fig.9

>I think the reviewer believes that the "previously described system" (p 21) is different from this. It is not, for my understanding. There is just less detail. Not sure how to word this best. It does link to fig. 9, but we say so in line 395.

p30,Fig14: "the offending base C_3" - is G_3

>Corrected.
