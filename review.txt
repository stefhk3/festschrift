Reviewer #1:
===========

There could be several criticisms on how the semantics is defined: 
starting from the use of lookahead, 
the priority of rewriting rules over reduction rules 
and to the syntactic constraints on how weak actions appear in the prefix without the ";". Indeed one could re-design the semantics to apply the moving of a weak bond to a strong one directly in the concert rules, without resorting to an extra "pre-congruence". 
The use of synchronisation function gamma is not argued, why you don't use taus? Is there any reason to prefer gammas over taus in this scenario? 
Also the conclusions are quite meagre. You could give some hints on future work, or on how you can add "rates" to CCB since your ultimate goal is to simulate reactions. 
Or you could think to extend the tool in [1] so to account for multiple sites.

Reviewer #2: 
============
The paper gives a fairly detailed account of the modeling of the DNA Mismatch Repair using the Calculus of Covalent Bonding (CCB) developed, in other contexts, by the authors. The motivation for using such calculus is that it allow to undo actions in an out of causal order fashion, namely to reverse an action without having previously undone all the other actions depending on it, and DNA Mismatch Repair apparently needs it. I am using the word "apparently" as it is not clear to me why this problem needs this, or if having this kind of reversibility is a common feature of all (bio)chemical reactions. In fact the introduction is from this point rather unsatisfactory and rather assertive, leaving the impression that everything can be done also in other calculi, which are discussed in the related work section. In this section the calculi appeared in literature are reviewed either because they model (bio)chemical reactions or because they encompass reversibility, and
even after it is not clear why the CCB should be used, namely what is the concrete advantage for using it. 

Now I come to the CCB itself. The bonds are represented by the unique shared key between two actions, but the curious point is that actions may synchronize (aka form a bond) according to a synchronization mapping which is meant only to give an observable, possibly different, action, which vanishes somehow. This choice can be understood if a notion of equivalence is provided, which is not the case in this calculus, even in the paper where it has been introduced. And indeed I do not follow it. Nondeterminism is absent, the only possibility being that two parallel components proceed independently making in this way possible synchronizations available and I find this counterintuitive as if everything would be deterministic then the mismatch to be repaired would not arise, but this is not my main issue here. What I find not properly explained in this paper is why the calculus should be in this way, in some sense I got the impression that rules are tailored for the problem tackled
and they lose the generality that a calculus should have. Now the possibility of introducing a rule tailored to a specific problem is possible as a "shortcut", thus expressible with the other rules, but this does not seem the case here, hence a thorough discussion is needed.

Some other issues on rules are:

* In the rule "rev s" it is impossible to have the same key twice (or at least is what I get from the other rules), so what is the purpose of the premise?  

* in the rule "concert1" the premise is written in an asymmetric way, namely P -(b)[k]-> P' -a[l]-> P"  but Q -[k]-> Q' and Q' -d[l]-> Q". Is there a reason? 

*  in the rules "concert2" and "concert3" you write in the premises "U ≡ P | Q" and in the conclusion the U is used for that, so why do not go directly for P | Q avoiding a useless part?
*  in the rules "concert2 act" and "concert3 act" you write fsh[k](t) in the premise, but I have not been able to find the "t" in the rules.

Another issue that puzzles me is that in the prefix (s) one gets the idea that the order in which the actions are written is irrelevant, but in the end, looking at the rules "move-r" and "move-l" it is not, and I am not able to understand why. An explanation here is needed, unless, but then you have to explain why the position of the weak action in a prefix where no weak action is present after the semicolon is relevant.

I want to stress that the main problem I have with the rules is the following one. With respect to the CCB proposed by the authors in the paper "A calculus for local reversibility" and "Local reversibility in a calculus of covalent bonding" there is a kind of proliferation of concert rules, and the examples suggest that they are needed as otherwise the DNA Mismatch Repair could not be modeled. The conclusion is that in the original CCB the specific problem tackled here cannot be modeled, and then the relevant question is which problems can be modeled in this extended CCB (a new name would be a good choice) and I believe that the authors have to justify better what they have done, explaining, for instance, why the problem cannot be modeled using the "old" CCB. 

Though the paper is well written, I find the necessity of being thoroughly revised, which implies an extensively rewriting, explaining better the following points that I already mentioned:

*  in (bio)chemical reactions bonds are created, and also destroyed. Why has the destruction of a bond to be considered as the reversing of its creation? Reversibility has a precise meaning which is, I believe, a bit different from the one implied by the plain breaking of a bond. 

*  why the calculus should have these rules? The fact that they are used in the examples is not an indication of their usefulness. 

*  the relation induced by the rules is a stratified one. Wouldn't be better to consider a very abstract one without "labels"?, this would allow to define the synchronization algebra not as a mapping but as a plain relation, which I believe is better.

Please revise the bibliography properly, some papers have titles written differently (pi or the corresponding greek letter as an example) and some others do not have the proper author (e.g. the paper "The Chemical abstract machine" is authored by Berry and Boudol, not by De Nicola and Montanari), check also capital letters.





Reviewer #3:

1. The process terms describing the systems are long and somehow difficult to follows. For
instance, the given example, involving only 6 pairs of bases, results in a half a page formula (page
22). While there is some effort to simplify the term, the notation is still long and much of the text in
pages 23-29 contains redundant information. A suggestion here is the use something similar to the
global-local handling notation used in the K-framework (see, e.g., https://kframework.org/).

>I understand this is asking for some formal short notation. I will check that kframework. 

2. Quite often, graphs are useful in grasping intuition on process terms. Maybe developing a
graphical representation of the CCB processes may simplify understanding and pave a way towards
including geometrical information on DNA shape.

Reviewer #4: 
============

-	My first concern regards the design decisions for the extensions of the calculus. The paper does not sufficiently motivate these extensions and it is not clear if they have been made (and can be applied) only for the purposes of modeling the specific case study. I also wonder: what are the limitations of the extensions and is it possible to generalize the construct to a form that can fully capture concerted reactions?

-	Secondly, I have some concerns about the technical aspects of the new rules. First, it is not clear that the rules sufficiently take sites into account. Furthermore, in rule concert3, it appears that while executing a concerted action an action may be reversed in unrelated processes, i.e. processes that were not involved in execution of the weak action. I understand that this was not the intention. I give more details about this in the "Detailed Comments" below.

-	Furthermore, I find the presentation of the paper to have a number of shortcomings. On the one hand, the paper contains a lot of repetition from [25]. In fact most of Section 3 is repeated from [25], including examples pertaining to the original version of the calculus. On the other hand, the new aspects of the calculus are not sufficiently discussed nor motivated and I expect that the paper in its present form will be quite difficult to read for someone with no knowledge of CCB as very little intuitive explanation is given. Regarding this second point, I would recommend to the authors to introduce the calculus and its extension informally through a simple but realistic example in the introduction that will highlight the main idea and modeling approach of the calculus and illustrate the need for the proposed extension.

-	As far as the case study is concerned, as the authors briefly discuss, important spatial issues are not considered in the model and in fact the model appears to allow transitions that do not take place in reality. It would be good if the paper discusses upfront these limitations and argues about the merits and potential of the approach.

* line 194: AL is defined to be the set of action labels and then as the forward actions AK, the reverse actions and the concerted actions. However, on lines 128-131 action labels are considered as the set \calA \cup \underline{\calA}. 

Overall, your references to actions and action labels are not the standard ones found in classical process calculi: roughly actions are the objects that decorate transitions. As this can be confusing to the reader, try to be consistent in the names used for the various terms. A table collecting all the notions and notations and how these form the syntax of the language might be useful.
 
* On line 211 in the definition of keys(P) you assume that b could be associated with a key but notation does not permit this.

* What is the point of the inductive definitions for std and fsn? Couldn't they be defined as:
	std(P) 		iff 	keys(P) = \emptyset
	fsh[m](P)	iff  	n\not\in keys(P)

* Rule act1, Figure 3: I don't think you need the premise fsh[k](\mu).

* Rule aux1: what is t in the premise and is this clause really needed?

** Concert rules: 
What puzzles me in these rules is that the actions executed e.g. by P and P' need not originate from the same site, e.g. it could be that P = \sigma1 | \sigma2 and the (b)[k] action originates from \sigma1 whereas the \underline(a)[l] action from \sigma2. So, I can't see how you are ensuring that a bond of the same site is reversed.

By the way, I don't think \equiv has been defined and \alpha is not used according to its intended use as described on line 136. Furthermore, note that the label on R->R' in concert3 does not follow the defined syntax.

In rules concert2 and concert3, it appears that if the concerted action involves a weak action in both "molecules" it is sufficient to reverse a strong action in only one of them. Can you give some motivation on that?

And as far as rule concert3 is concerned, I am quite puzzled.  It appears to me that its enunciation may not capture the intended meaning. The rule seems to enable the reversal of an action in unrelated processes, i.e. processes that were not involved in execution of the weak action: Q and R could be parallel compositions with distinct subprocesses/sites enabling each of the actions. This may arise since the \alpha transition of Q is not necessarily an auxiliary transition. 

Overall, I find these rules rather ad hoc and not sufficiently discussed or motivated. I also wonder if the rules are sufficient to capture all possible types of concerted actions and, if not, whether they can be elegantly extended to more general concerted rules if it should be needed…

* Example 3: There are some typos in the example that could be resolved by setting the second $b$ in the process under study to a $d$ and the $d$ action to $f$.

* concert2+3 act: t should be \eta

* concert2+3 res: As far as I understand L does not contain reverse action labels so the side conditions should be corrected.

* Figure 8: The last three rules should be upgraded to \mu.P processes.

* Move Figures 7 and 8 close to where they are referenced.

** The notions of promotion of actions is not made sufficiently clear. An example of this in terms of a chemical reaction would be useful.
 
Is it possible for any of the strong actions to be used in the promotion? This has confused me in terms of what the actions in s signify? The reduction rules seems to suggest that they are just bonding sites and it is only the keys of the actions that capture bonds. 

* Line 316: the the => the

* Line 326: possesSES

** It is not clear to me how the properties of reversible computation are inherited from the old CCB to the new one.  Some discussion about how the state space is affected by the extensions and new rules, or some other explanation would be useful. 

In this respect, I wonder what properties one might prove about concerted transitions.

Reviewer #5:
============

I found the topic of the paper interesting and relevant. Nonetheless,
some aspects of the presentation needs further clarifications.

- Contribution: I think that the presentation needs to stress on the
  relevance of the contribution. To start with, I would suggest to
  include a description of the main contributions in the
  introduction. I wonder whether the emphasis of the contribution is
  on the proposed extension of CCB or on the case study (as apparently
  suggested by the current introduction). I would have appreciated a
  discussion about the shortcomings of the original definition of CCB:
  does this contribution imply that MMR cannot be modelled with the
  primitives originally proposed in CCB? Wouldn't be possible to model
  MMR at the expenses of encoding the behaviour of complex prefixes as
  low-level (artificial) reactions? I also wonder whether the new
  primitives are general enough for modelling bio-chemical reactions
  or ADN problems? In other words, does the new extension of CCB
  capture the essence of bonding or is it just an ad hoc extension for
  modelling MMR but may require further extensions to accommodate
  other phenomena?  As far as the modelling of MMR is concern, I
  wonder whether the proposed formalisation is correct in some sense?
  It seems that the proposed model can simulate the expected behaviour
  of MMR, but what about the remaining behaviours (if any)? It is
  mentioned that the proposed formalisation may allow for additional
  computations because it misses spatial information. Can we state
  that additional computations are "only" does that arise from the
  lack of spatial representation?

- The technical development needs
  clarifications/adjustments/explanations. In particular,

  * The separation between strong and weak actions, which however can
    be mixed in the synchronisation algebra (e.g., a weak action may
    synchronise with a strong one, or two strong actions can be
    synchronised and become a weak one). What is the rationale? Does
    this distinction actually match a chemical phenomenon?

  * The non-compositional nature of the semantics. Does this reflect a
    constraint already present in chemical reactions?

  * The (stratified) semantics for reductions and transitions.

L12. Definition of gamma. Actions have been divided into strong and
weak but gamma allows for mixed synchronisations. Moreover, the
synchronisation of two strong actions can give a weak action. This may
deserve further explanation. Also, synchronisation would allow
multiway synchronisations. Consider gamma defined such that gamma(a,a)
= a and P -a[k]-> P', Q -a[k]-> Q' and R -a[k]-> R', then

P -a[k]-> P'    Q -a[k]-> Q'

 P | Q -a[k]-> P' | Q'           R -a[k]-> R'

Hence, we have a bond among three components. Is it the case that a
bond may connect an arbitrarily large number of components in chemical
reactions?

Fig.2. I wonder whether defining sites in prefixes as a commutative
monoid with some identity would avoid the "duplication" of rules.

L36. k() -> I would write either k or k(_) (also for other functions,
as keys), otherwise seems to be the application to the unit value
(empty tuple).

L41. keys(S) = keys(P) if S = P -> It should be mentioned that
recursion should be guarded, otherwise keys will be undefined in some
cases.  Analogously, for std and fsh.

P10. Fig.3. The communication rule together with the liberal
definition of gamma allows for mixed, multiway synchronisations. This
may worth an illustrative example.

It is unclear the need of both rules concert1 and concert2. It seems
that concert2 subsumes concert1 (after all Q can be taken as a
parallel composition of processes). Can you provide an example of a
reduction by rule concert2 that cannot be obtained from concert1.

P11. Fig 5. Puzzled about the fourth premise of rule concert3. None of
the rules in Fig3-6 allows for the derivation of a transition labelled
by a pair of reverse actions; moreover, this label does not belong to
the set of groups of concerted actions defined in P8L45 (AK × AK ∪ AK
× AK × AK).

Also for the conclusion, it seems that there is a misplaced bracket,
i.e., {e[k],f[l]},j[m] instead of {e[k],f[l],j[m]}


It seems to me that there is an underlying design choice that
complicates the treatment of reductions (and it is the cause of the
proposed extension): The semantics is essentially non-compositional
for weak actions. Not being versed on (bio)chemistry, it is unclear to
me if this choice actually reflects the essence of biochemical
reactions or if it is a shortcoming of the proposed formalisation.

This also concerns the semantics of restriction.

Assume that P | Q | R -{e[k],\underline f[k]}-> is derivable by the
application of rule concert2.

Now consider (( P | Q)\g | R)\h where:

 1- g and h are names different from the ones involved in the
    derivation of the transition above, i.e., {g,h} \cap {a,b,c,d,e,f}
    = emptyset where {a,b,c,d} are the names of the actions in the
    premises of the derivation for the transition above.

 2- structural rules do not allow to move out restrictions, i.e.,
    {g,h} \subset (fn(P) \cap fn(Q) \cap (R))

Hence, (( P | Q)\g | R)\h -{e[k],\underline f[k]}-> cannot be derived.

This is quite counter-intuitive since restrictions of names that do
not participate in the interaction can block synchronisation. Does
this behaviour corresponds to any chemical restriction?

P15.

L9. Concert2 rule makes me wonder about the need of accounting for
longer chains. Is it concert2 rule enough or in the future we will
need versions involving 4, 5, ... parallel processes?  (This is
somehow related to the concern about the non-compositional definition
of the semantics).

P16.

L43. AK)Proc -> AK) \times Proc
 
I'm a bit lost about the need of introducing the (stratified?)
transition relation of Def.2.

Is Definition 2 saying that reductions have priority over transitions?
This is what I understand from Ex 6, but this is hard to grasp from
the definition.  In such case, wouldn't be easier to state that terms
are first normalised (according to =>)? If I correctly understand the
proposed formalisation, albeit not confluent, => is strongly
normalising. Hence, take nf(P) = {P' | P =>* P'' =/=>.} and define the
(wanted?) transition relation (which I denote with ~~> ) as follows

P ~alpha~> P' if  there exists P''\in nf(P) s.t. P'' -alpha-> P'.

Besides what does rho(con(r)) mean?.

Is the provided formalisation relevant for the remaining of this
paper?

I would have appreciated a detailed calculation of the Example 6 to
understand why Def 2 avoids the unwanted computations.

It seems that -> is overloaded... It may make sense to use a different
symbol for the transition relation introduced in Def. 2.

P20.

L48. Definition of gamma. There are cases in which weak actions
synchronise with strong actions, e.g., γ(s,p3) = sp3. Is the resulting
action strong or weak?

P22. 

Terms representing the model without any abstraction are a bit scary
and I cannot get why this is meaningful. It seems hard to me to cope
with manual verification of the illustrated transitions. Besides,
there is not evidence of their derivations. Have they been derived
manually?

As far as I understand, the reactions are "local" in the sense that
they involve just a few of the components (if we disregard freshness
conditions on keys). If this is the case, it may make sense to show
only the relevant parts of the derivation of the transition.

P30.

L47-54. If I correctly understand, the proposed model may exhibit more
behaviours than those that can actually happen in reality (because of
missing information, e.g., spatial information). This makes me wonder
about the "correctness" of the modelling. It seems that the proposed
representation and the semantics of the calculus suffices to capture
(simulates) some expected behaviour and allows for more
reductions. The underlying question is: are all expected behaviours
allowed in the model? Can we ascertain that extra behaviour arises
only because of the missing details about spatial information?

Could spatial information be modelled by recasting to operators in the
model? Restriction, renaming of actions, etc?
